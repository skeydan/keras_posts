__Time series prediction (forecasting) has experienced dramatic improvements in predictive accuracy as a result of the data science machine learning and deep learning evolution__. As these ML/DL tools have evolved, businesses and financial instutions are now able to forecast better by applying these new technologies to solve old problems. In this article, we showcase the use of a special type of __Deep Learning model called an [LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory)__, which is useful for problems involving [sequences with autocorrelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocorrelation). We analyze a famous historical data set called ["sunspots"](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/sunspot.month.html) (a [sunspot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle) is a solar phenomenon wherein a dark spot forms on the surface of the sun). We'll show you how you can use an LSTM model to predict sunspots ten years into the future with an LSTM model.

## Tutorial Overview

This code tutorial goes along with a [presentation on Time Series Deep Learning](https://github.com/business-science/presentations/tree/master/2018_04_19_SP_Global_Time_Series_Deep_Learning) given to [SP Global](https://www.spglobal.com/) on Thursday, April 19, 2018. The slide deck that complements this article is available for download. 

This is an __advanced tutorial__ implementing __deep learning for time series__ and several other complex machine learning topics such as backtesting cross validation. For those seeking an introduction to __Keras in R__, please check out [Customer Analytics: Using Deep Learning With Keras To Predict Customer Churn](http://www.business-science.io/business/2017/11/28/customer_churn_analysis_keras.html).

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

* Develop a __Stateful LSTM Model__ with the `keras` package, which connects to the [R TensorFlow backend](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/).
* Apply a Keras Stateful LSTM Model to a __famous time series, Sunspots__.
* Perform __Time Series Cross Validation using Backtesting__ with the `rsample` package [rolling forecast origin resampling](https://topepo.github.io/rsample/articles/Applications/Time_Series.html).
* __Visualize Backtest Sampling Plans and Prediction Results__ with `ggplot2` and `cowplot`.
* Evaluate whether or not a time series may be a good candidate for an LSTM model by reviewing the __Autocorrelation Function (ACF) plot__.



The end result is a __high performance deep learning algorithm__ that does an excellent job at predicting ten years of sunspots! Here's the plot of the __Backtested Keras Stateful LSTM Model__.

## Applications in Business

Time series prediction (forecasting) has a dramatic effect on the top and bottom line. In business, we could be interested in predicting which day of the month, quarter, or year that large expenditures are going to occur or we could be interested in understanding how the consumer price index (CPI) will change over the course of the next six months. These are common questions that impact organizations both on a microeconomic and macroeconomic level. While the data set used in this tutorial is not a "business" data set, it shows the power of the __tool-problem fit__, meaning that using the right tool for the job can offer tremendous improvements in accuracy. __The net result is Increased prediction accuracy ultimately leads to quantifiable improvements to the top and bottom line__.

## Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Models

A __Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model__ is a powerful type of recurrent neural network (RNN). The blog article, ["Understanding LSTM Networks"](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/), does an excellent job at explaining the underlying complexity in an easy to understand way. Here's an image depicting the LSTM internal cell archetecture that enables it to persist for long term states (in addition to short term), which traditional RNN's have difficulty with:


```{r, echo=F, fig.align="center", out.width="50%"}

```


<p class="text-center date">Source: <a href="http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/">Understanding LSTM Networks</a></p>

LSTMs are quite useful in time series prediction tasks involving __autocorrelation__, the presence of correlation between the time series and lagged versions of itself, because of their ability to maintain state and recognize patterns over the length of the time series. The recurrent architecture enables the states to persist, or communicate between updates of the weights as each epoch progresses. Further, the LSTM cell archecture enhances the RNN by enabling long term persistence in addition to short term, which is fascinating!

In Keras, LSTM's can be operated in a "stateful" mode, which according to the Keras documentation:

>  The last state for each sample at index _i_ in a batch will be used as initial state for the sample of index _i_ in the following batch

In normal (or "stateless") mode, Keras shuffles the samples, and the dependencies between the time series and the lagged version of itself are lost. However, __when run in "stateful" mode, we can often get high accuracy results by leveraging the autocorrelations present in the time series__. 

We'll explain more as we go through this tutorial. For now, just understand that LSTM's can be really useful for time series problems involving autocorrelation and Keras has the capability to create stateful LSTMs that are perfect for time series modeling. 



## Sunspots Data Set

[Sunspots](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/sunspot.month.html) is a famous data set that ships with R (refer to the `datasets` library). The dataset tracks sunspots, which are the occurrence of a dark spot on the sun. Here's an image from NASA showing the solar phenomenon. Pretty cool!


```{r, echo = F,  fig.align="center", out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sunspot_nasa.jpg")
```

<p class="text-center date">Source: <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/largest-sunspot-of-solar-cycle">NASA</a></p>

The dataset we use in this tutorial is called `sunspots.month`, and it contains 265 years (from 1749 through 2013) of monthly data on number of sunspots per month. 

```{r, echo=F, fig.height=3.5}
library(tidyverse)
library(timetk)
library(tidyquant)

sun_spots <- datasets::sunspot.month %>%
    tk_tbl() %>%
    mutate(index = as_date(index))

sun_spots %>%
    ggplot(aes(index, value)) +
    geom_point(color = palette_light()[[1]], alpha = 0.5) +
    theme_tq() +
    labs(
        title    = "Sunspots Dataset",
        subtitle = "From 1749 to 2013 (Full Data Set)"
    )
```



## Implementing An LSTM To Predict Sunspots

Time to get to business. Let's predict sunspots. Here's our objective:

__Objective__: 
Use an LSTM model to generate a forecast of sunspots that __spans 10-years into the future__.

### 1.0 Libraries

Here are the libraries needed for this tutorial. All are available on CRAN. You can install with `install.packages()` if you do not have them installed already. __NOTE: Before proceeding with this code tutorial, make sure to update all packages as previous versions of these packages may not be compatible with the code used. One issue we are aware of is upgrading to `lubridate` version 1.7.4.__

```{r}
# Core Tidyverse
library(tidyverse)
library(glue)
library(forcats)

# Time Series
library(timetk)
library(tidyquant)
library(tibbletime)

# Visualization
library(cowplot)

# Preprocessing
library(recipes)

# Sampling / Accuracy
library(rsample)
library(yardstick) 

# Modeling
library(keras)
```


If you have not previously run Keras in R, you will need to install Keras using the `install_keras()` function.

``` {r, eval = F}
# Install Keras if you have not installed before
install_keras()
```

### 2.0 Data 

The dataset, `sunspot.month`, is avaliable for all of us (it ships with base R). It's a `ts` class (not tidy), so we'll convert to a tidy data set using the `tk_tbl()` function from `timetk`. We use this instead of `as.tibble()` from `tibble` to automatically preserve the time series index as a `zoo` `yearmon` index. Last, we'll convert the `zoo` index to date using `lubridate::as_date()` (loaded with `tidyquant`) and then change to a `tbl_time` object to make time series operations easier.

```{r}
sun_spots <- datasets::sunspot.month %>%
    tk_tbl() %>%
    mutate(index = as_date(index)) %>%
    as_tbl_time(index = index)

sun_spots
```

### 3.0 Exploratory Data Analysis

The time series is long (265 years!). We can visualize the time series both full (265 years) and zoomed in on the first 50 years to get a feel for the series. 

#### 3.1 Visualizing Sunspot Data With Cowplot

We'll make to `ggplot`s and combine them using `cowplot::plot_grid()`. Note that for the zoomed in plot, we make use of `tibbletime::time_filter()`, which is an easy way to perform time-based filtering. 

```{r, fig.height=7}
p1 <- sun_spots %>%
    ggplot(aes(index, value)) +
    geom_point(color = palette_light()[[1]], alpha = 0.5) +
    theme_tq() +
    labs(
        title = "From 1749 to 2013 (Full Data Set)"
    )

p2 <- sun_spots %>%
    filter_time("start" ~ "1800") %>%
    ggplot(aes(index, value)) +
    geom_line(color = palette_light()[[1]], alpha = 0.5) +
    geom_point(color = palette_light()[[1]]) +
    geom_smooth(method = "loess", span = 0.2, se = FALSE) +
    theme_tq() +
    labs(
        title = "1749 to 1800 (Zoomed In To Show Cycle)",
        caption = "datasets::sunspot.month"
    )

p_title <- ggdraw() + 
    draw_label("Sunspots", size = 18, fontface = "bold", colour = palette_light()[[1]])

plot_grid(p_title, p1, p2, ncol = 1, rel_heights = c(0.1, 1, 1))
```

At first glance, it looks like this series should be easy to predict. However, we can see that the cycle (10-year frequency) and amplitude (count of sunspots) seems to change at least between years 1780 and 1800. This creates some challenges.


#### 3.2 Evaluating The ACF

The next thing we can do is determine whether or not an LSTM model may be a good approach. The LSTM will leverage autocorrelation to generate sequence predictions. Our goal is to produce a 10-year forecast using __batch forecasting__ (a technique for creating a single forecast batch accros the forecast region, which is in contrast to a single-prediction that is iteratively performed one or several steps into the future). The batch prediction will only work if the autocorrelation used is beyond ten years. Let's inspect.

First, we need to review the Autocorrelation Function (ACF), which is the correlation between the time series of interest in lagged versions of itself. The `acf()` function from the `stats` library returns the ACF values for each lag as a plot. However, we'd like to get the ACF values as data so we can investigate the underlying data. To do so, we'll create a custom function, `tidy_acf()`, to return the ACF values in a tidy tibble.

```{r}
tidy_acf <- function(data, value, lags = 0:20) {
    
    value_expr <- enquo(value)
    
    acf_values <- data %>%
        pull(value) %>%
        acf(lag.max = tail(lags, 1), plot = FALSE) %>%
        .$acf %>%
        .[,,1]
    
    ret <- tibble(acf = acf_values) %>%
        rowid_to_column(var = "lag") %>%
        mutate(lag = lag - 1) %>%
        filter(lag %in% lags)
    
    return(ret)
}
```

Next, let's test the function out to make sure it works as intended. The function takes our tidy time series, extracts the value column, and returns the ACF values along with the associated lag in a tibble format. We have 601 autocorrelation (one for the time series and it's 600 lags). All looks good. 

```{r}
max_lag <- 12 * 50

sun_spots %>%
    tidy_acf(value, lags = 0:max_lag)
```

Let's plot the ACF with `ggplot2` to determine if a high-autocorrelation lag exists beyond 10 years. 

```{r, fig.height=3.5}
sun_spots %>%
    tidy_acf(value, lags = 0:max_lag) %>%
    ggplot(aes(lag, acf)) +
    geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color = palette_light()[[1]]) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 120, size = 3, color = palette_light()[[2]]) +
    annotate("text", label = "10 Year Mark", x = 130, y = 0.8, 
             color = palette_light()[[2]], size = 6, hjust = 0) +
    theme_tq() +
    labs(title = "ACF: Sunspots")
```

This is good news. We have autocorrelation in excess of 0.5 beyond lag 120 (the 10-year mark). We can theoretically use one of the high autocorrelation lags to develop an LSTM model. 

```{r, fig.height=3.5}
sun_spots %>%
    tidy_acf(value, lags = 115:135) %>%
    ggplot(aes(lag, acf)) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 120, size = 3, color = palette_light()[[2]]) +
    geom_segment(aes(xend = lag, yend = 0), color = palette_light()[[1]]) +
    geom_point(color = palette_light()[[1]], size = 2) +
    geom_label(aes(label = acf %>% round(2)), vjust = -1,
              color = palette_light()[[1]]) +
    annotate("text", label = "10 Year Mark", x = 121, y = 0.8, 
             color = palette_light()[[2]], size = 5, hjust = 0) +
    theme_tq() +
    labs(title = "ACF: Sunspots",
         subtitle = "Zoomed in on Lags 115 to 135")
```

Upon inspection, the optimal lag occurs at lag 125. This isn't necessarily the one we will use since we have more to consider with batch forecasting with a Keras LSTM. With that said, here's how you can `filter()` to get the best lag. 

```{r}
optimal_lag_setting <- sun_spots %>%
    tidy_acf(value, lags = 115:135) %>%
    filter(acf == max(acf)) %>%
    pull(lag)

optimal_lag_setting
```


### Backtesting: Time Series Cross Validation

__Cross validation__ is the process of developing models on sub-sampled data against a validation set with the goal of determining an expected accuracy level and error range. __Time series is a bit different than non-sequential data when it comes to cross validation__. Specifically, the time dependency on previous time samples must be preserved when developing a sampling plan. We can create a cross validation sampling plan using by offseting the window used to select sequential sub-samples. __In finance, this type of analysis is often called "Backtesting", which takes a time series and splits it into multiple uninterupted sequences offset at various windows that can be tested for strategies on both current and past observations.__ 

A recent development is [the `rsample` package](https://topepo.github.io/rsample/), which makes cross validation sampling plans very easy to implement. Further, the `rsample` package has __Backtesting__ covered. The vignette, ["Time Series Analysis Example"](https://topepo.github.io/rsample/articles/Applications/Time_Series.html), describes a procedure that uses the `rolling_origin()` function to create samples designed for __time series cross validation__. We'll use this approach.

#### Developing a Backtesting Strategy

The sampling plan we create uses 50 years (`initial` = 12 x 50 samples) for the training set and ten years (`assess` = 12 x 10) for the testing (validation) set. We select a `skip` span of twenty years (`skip` = 12 x 20) to evenly distribute the samples into 11 sets that span the entire 265 years of sunspots history. Last, we select `cumulative = FALSE` to allow the origin to shift which ensures that models on more recent data are not given an unfair advantage (more observations) that those on less recent data. The tibble return contains the `rolling_origin_resamples`.

```{r}
periods_train <- 12 * 50
periods_test  <- 12 * 10
skip_span     <- 12 * 20

rolling_origin_resamples <- rolling_origin(
    sun_spots,
    initial    = periods_train,
    assess     = periods_test,
    cumulative = FALSE,
    skip       = skip_span
)

rolling_origin_resamples
```

#### Visualizing the Backtesting Strategy

We can visualize the resamples with two custom functions. The first, `plot_split()`, plots one of the resampling splits using `ggplot2`. Note that an `expand_y_axis` argument is added to expand the date range to the full `sun_spots` dataset date range. This will become useful when we visualize all plots together. 

```{r}
# Plotting function for a single split
plot_split <- function(split, expand_y_axis = TRUE, alpha = 1, size = 1, base_size = 14) {
    
    # Manipulate data
    train_tbl <- training(split) %>%
        add_column(key = "training") 
    
    test_tbl  <- testing(split) %>%
        add_column(key = "testing") 
    
    data_manipulated <- bind_rows(train_tbl, test_tbl) %>%
        as_tbl_time(index = index) %>%
        mutate(key = fct_relevel(key, "training", "testing"))
        
    # Collect attributes
    train_time_summary <- train_tbl %>%
        tk_index() %>%
        tk_get_timeseries_summary()
    
    test_time_summary <- test_tbl %>%
        tk_index() %>%
        tk_get_timeseries_summary()
    
    # Visualize
    g <- data_manipulated %>%
        ggplot(aes(x = index, y = value, color = key)) +
        geom_line(size = size, alpha = alpha) +
        theme_tq(base_size = base_size) +
        scale_color_tq() +
        labs(
            title    = glue("Split: {split$id}"),
            subtitle = glue("{train_time_summary$start} to {test_time_summary$end}"),
            y = "", x = ""
        ) +
        theme(legend.position = "none") 
    
    if (expand_y_axis) {
        
        sun_spots_time_summary <- sun_spots %>% 
            tk_index() %>% 
            tk_get_timeseries_summary()
        
        g <- g +
            scale_x_date(limits = c(sun_spots_time_summary$start, 
                                    sun_spots_time_summary$end))
    }
    
    return(g)
}
```

The `plot_split()` function takes one split (in this case Slice01), and returns a visual of the sampling strategy. We expand the axis to the range for the full dataset using `expand_y_axis = TRUE`. 

```{r, fig.height=3.5}
rolling_origin_resamples$splits[[1]] %>%
    plot_split(expand_y_axis = TRUE) +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```


The second function, `plot_sampling_plan()`, scales the `plot_split()` function to all of the samples using `purrr` and `cowplot`.

```{r}
# Plotting function that scales to all splits 
plot_sampling_plan <- function(sampling_tbl, expand_y_axis = TRUE, 
                               ncol = 3, alpha = 1, size = 1, base_size = 14, 
                               title = "Sampling Plan") {
    
    # Map plot_split() to sampling_tbl
    sampling_tbl_with_plots <- sampling_tbl %>%
        mutate(gg_plots = map(splits, plot_split, 
                              expand_y_axis = expand_y_axis,
                              alpha = alpha, base_size = base_size))
    
    # Make plots with cowplot
    plot_list <- sampling_tbl_with_plots$gg_plots 
    
    p_temp <- plot_list[[1]] + theme(legend.position = "bottom")
    legend <- get_legend(p_temp)
    
    p_body  <- plot_grid(plotlist = plot_list, ncol = ncol)
    
    p_title <- ggdraw() + 
        draw_label(title, size = 18, fontface = "bold", colour = palette_light()[[1]])
    
    g <- plot_grid(p_title, p_body, legend, ncol = 1, rel_heights = c(0.05, 1, 0.05))
    
    return(g)
    
}
```


We can now visualize the entire backtesting strategy with `plot_sampling_plan()`. We can see how the sampling plan shifts the sampling window with each progressive slice of the train/test splits. 

```{r, fig.height=8}
rolling_origin_resamples %>%
    plot_sampling_plan(expand_y_axis = T, ncol = 3, alpha = 1, size = 1, base_size = 10, 
                       title = "Backtesting Strategy: Rolling Origin Sampling Plan")
```

And, we can set `expand_y_axis = FALSE` to zoom in on the samples. 

```{r, fig.height=8}
rolling_origin_resamples %>%
    plot_sampling_plan(expand_y_axis = F, ncol = 3, alpha = 1, size = 1, base_size = 10, 
                       title = "Backtesting Strategy: Zoomed In")
```

We'll use this backtesting strategy (11 samples from one time series each with 50/10 split in years and a 20 year offset) when testing the veracity of the LSTM model on the sunspots dataset. 

## The LSTM model

To begin, we'll develop an LSTM model on a single sample from the backtesting strategy, namely, the most recent slice. We'll then apply the model to all samples to investigate/validate the modeling performance. 

```{r}
split    <- rolling_origin_resamples$splits[[11]]
split_id <- rolling_origin_resamples$id[[11]]
```

We can reuse the `plot_split()` function to visualize the split. Set `expand_y_axis = FALSE` to zoom in on the subsample. 

```{r, fig.height=3.5}
plot_split(split, expand_y_axis = FALSE, size = 0.5) +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
    ggtitle(glue("Split: {split_id}"))
```

### Data Setup

First, let's combine the training and testing data sets into a single data set with a column `key` that specifies where they came from (either "training" or "testing)". Note that the `tbl_time` object will need to have the index respecified during the `bind_rows()` step, but [this issue](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues/3259) should be corrected in `dplyr` soon. 

```{r}
df_trn <- training(split)
df_tst <- testing(split)

df <- bind_rows(
    df_trn %>% add_column(key = "training"),
    df_tst %>% add_column(key = "testing")
) %>% 
    as_tbl_time(index = index)

df
```

### Preprocessing with Recipes

The LSTM algorithm will usually work better if the input data has been centered and scaled. We can conveniently accomplish this using the `recipes` package. In addition to `step_center` and `step_scale`, we're using `step_sqrt` to reduce variance and remov outliers. The actual transformations are executed when we `bake` the data according to the recipe: 

```{r}
rec_obj <- recipe(value ~ ., df) %>%
    step_sqrt(value) %>%
    step_center(value) %>%
    step_scale(value) %>%
    prep()

df_processed_tbl <- bake(rec_obj, df)

df_processed_tbl
```

Next, let's capture the original center and scale so we can invert the steps after modeling. The square root step can then simply be undone by squaring the back-transformed data. 

```{r}
center_history <- rec_obj$steps[[2]]$means["value"]
scale_history  <- rec_obj$steps[[3]]$sds["value"]

c("center" = center_history, "scale" = scale_history)
```

### Creating the model

We need a plan for building the LSTM. First, a couple __PRO TIPS__ with LSTM's:

__Tensor Format__:
* Predictors (X) must be a 3D Array with dimensions: [samples, timesteps, features]: The first dimension is the length of values, the second is the number of time steps (lags), and the third is the number of predictors (1 if univariate or _n_ if multivariate)
* Outcomes/Targets (y) must be a 2D Array with dimensions: [samples, timesteps]: The first dimension is the length of values and the second is the number of time steps (lags)

__Training/Testing__:
* The training and testing length must be evenly divisble (e.g. training length / testing length must be a whole number)

__Batch Size__:

* The batch size is the number of training examples in one forward/backward pass of a RNN before a weight update
* The batch size must be evenly divisible into both the training an testing lengths (e.g. training length / batch size and testing length / batch size must both be whole numbers) 

__Time Steps__:

* A time step is the number of lags included in the training/testing set
* For our example, our we use a single lag

__Epochs__:

* The epochs are the total number of forward/backward pass iterations
* Typically more improves model performance unless overfitting occurs at which time the validation accuracy/loss will not improve

Taking this in, we can come up with a plan. We'll select a prediction of window 120 months (10 years) or the length of our test set. The best correlation occurs at 125, but this is not evenly divisble by the forecasting range. We could increase the forecast horizon, but this offers a minimal increase in autocorrelation. We can select a batch size of 40 units which evenly divides into the number of testing and training observations. We select time steps = 1, which is because we are only using one lag. Finally, we set `epochs = 300`, but this will need to be adjusted to balance the bias/variance tradeoff. 

```{r}

lag_setting  <- 120 # = nrow(df_tst)
batch_size   <- 40
train_length <- 440
tsteps       <- 1
epochs       <- 300
```

##### 5.1.5 2D And 3D Train/Test Arrays

We can then setup the training and testing sets in the correct format (arrays) as follows. Remember, LSTM's need 3D arrays for predictors (X) and 2D arrays for outcomes/targets (y). 

```{r}
# Training Set
lag_train_tbl <- df_processed_tbl %>%
    mutate(value_lag = lag(value, n = lag_setting)) %>%
    filter(!is.na(value_lag)) %>%
    filter(key == "training") %>%
    tail(train_length)

x_train_vec <- lag_train_tbl$value_lag
x_train_arr <- array(data = x_train_vec, dim = c(length(x_train_vec), 1, 1))

y_train_vec <- lag_train_tbl$value
y_train_arr <- array(data = y_train_vec, dim = c(length(y_train_vec), 1))

# Testing Set
lag_test_tbl <- df_processed_tbl %>%
    mutate(
        value_lag = lag(value, n = lag_setting)
    ) %>%
    filter(!is.na(value_lag)) %>%
    filter(key == "testing")

x_test_vec <- lag_test_tbl$value_lag
x_test_arr <- array(data = x_test_vec, dim = c(length(x_test_vec), 1, 1))

y_test_vec <- lag_test_tbl$value
y_test_arr <- array(data = y_test_vec, dim = c(length(y_test_vec), 1))
```

##### 5.1.6 Building The LSTM Model

We can build an LSTM model using the `keras_model_sequential()` and adding layers like stacking bricks. We'll use two LSTM layers each with 50 units. The first LSTM layer takes the required input shape, which is the [time steps, number of features]. The batch size is just our batch size. We set the first layer to `return_sequences = TRUE` and `stateful = TRUE`. The second layer is the same with the exception of `batch_size`, which only needs to be specified in the first layer, and `return_sequences = FALSE` which does not return the time stamp dimension (2D shape is returned versus a 3D shape from the first LSTM). We tack on a `layer_dense(units = 1)`, which is the standard ending to a keras sequential model. Last, we `compile()` using the `loss = "mae"` and the popular `optimizer = "adam"`.

```{r}
model <- keras_model_sequential()

model %>%
    layer_lstm(units            = 50, 
               input_shape      = c(tsteps, 1), 
               batch_size       = batch_size,
               return_sequences = TRUE, 
               stateful         = TRUE) %>% 
    layer_lstm(units            = 50, 
               return_sequences = FALSE, 
               stateful         = TRUE) %>% 
    layer_dense(units = 1)

model %>% 
    compile(loss = 'mae', optimizer = 'adam')

model
```

##### 5.1.7 Fitting The LSTM Model

Next, we can fit our stateful LSTM using a `for` loop (we do this to manually reset states). This will take a minute or so for 300 epochs to run. We set `shuffle = FALSE` to preserve sequences, and we manually reset the states after each epoch using `reset_states()`.

```{r, eval = F}
for (i in 1:epochs) {
    model %>% fit(x          = x_train_arr, 
                  y          = y_train_arr, 
                  batch_size = batch_size,
                  epochs     = 1, 
                  verbose    = 1, 
                  shuffle    = FALSE)
    
    model %>% reset_states()
    cat("Epoch: ", i)
    
}
```


##### 5.1.8 Predicting Using The LSTM Model

We can then make predictions on the test set, `x_test_arr`, using the `predict()` function. We can retransform our predictions using the `scale_history` and `center_history`, which were previously saved and then squaring the result. Finally, we combine the predictions with the original data in one column using `reduce()` and a custom `time_bind_rows()` function. 

```{r, eval=F}
# Make Predictions
pred_out <- model %>% 
    predict(x_test_arr, batch_size = batch_size) %>%
    .[,1] 

# Retransform values
pred_tbl <- tibble(
    index   = lag_test_tbl$index,
    value   = (pred_out * scale_history + center_history)^2
) 

# Combine actual data with predictions
tbl_1 <- df_trn %>%
    add_column(key = "actual")

tbl_2 <- df_tst %>%
    add_column(key = "actual")

tbl_3 <- pred_tbl %>%
    add_column(key = "predict")

# Create time_bind_rows() to solve dplyr issue
time_bind_rows <- function(data_1, data_2, index) {
    index_expr <- enquo(index)
    bind_rows(data_1, data_2) %>%
        as_tbl_time(index = !! index_expr)
}

ret <- list(tbl_1, tbl_2, tbl_3) %>%
    reduce(time_bind_rows, index = index) %>%
    arrange(key, index) %>%
    mutate(key = as_factor(key))

ret
```


```{r, echo=F}
ret <- readRDS("models/ret.rds")

ret
```


##### 5.1.9 Assessing Performance Of The LSTM On A Single Split

We can use the `yardstick` package to assess performance using the `rmse()` function, which returns the root mean squared error (RMSE). Our data is in the long format (optimal format for visualizing with `ggplot2`), so we'll create a wrapper function `calc_rmse()` that processes the data into the format needed for `yardstick::rmse()`. 

```{r}
calc_rmse <- function(prediction_tbl) {
    
    rmse_calculation <- function(data) {
        data %>%
            spread(key = key, value = value) %>%
            select(-index) %>%
            filter(!is.na(predict)) %>%
            rename(
                truth    = actual,
                estimate = predict
            ) %>%
            rmse(truth, estimate)
    }
    
    safe_rmse <- possibly(rmse_calculation, otherwise = NA)
    
    safe_rmse(prediction_tbl)
        
}
```

We can inspect the RMSE on the model.    

```{r}
calc_rmse(ret)
```

The RMSE doesn't tell us the story. We need to visualize. _Note - The RMSE will come in handy in determining an expected error when we scale to all samples in the backtesting strategy._

##### 5.1.10 Visualizing The Single Prediction

Next, we make a plotting function, `plot_prediction()`, using `ggplot2` to visualize the results for a single sample.

```{r}
# Setup single plot function
plot_prediction <- function(data, id, alpha = 1, size = 2, base_size = 14) {
    
    rmse_val <- calc_rmse(data)
    
    g <- data %>%
        ggplot(aes(index, value, color = key)) +
        geom_point(alpha = alpha, size = size) + 
        theme_tq(base_size = base_size) +
        scale_color_tq() +
        theme(legend.position = "none") +
        labs(
            title = glue("{id}, RMSE: {round(rmse_val, digits = 1)}"),
            x = "", y = ""
        )
    
    return(g)
}
```


We can test out the plotting function setting the `id = split_id`, which is "Slice11".

```{r, fig.height=3.5}
ret %>% 
    plot_prediction(id = split_id, alpha = 0.65) +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

__The LSTM performed relatively well! The settings we selected seem to produce a decent model that picked up the trend. It jumped the gun on the next up-trend, but overall it exceeded my expectations. Now, we need to Backtest to see the true performance over time!__

#### 5.2 Backtesting The LSTM On All Eleven Samples

Once we have the LSTM working for one sample, scaling to all 11 is relatively simple. We just need to create an prediction function that can be mapped to the sampling plan data contained in `rolling_origin_resamples`. 

##### 5.2.1 Creating An LSTM Prediction Function

This step looks intimidating, but it's actually straightforward. We copy the code from [__Section 5.1__](#single-lstm) into a function. We'll make it a safe function, which is a good practice for any long-running mapping processes to prevent a single failure from stopping the entire process. 

```{r, eval = T}
predict_keras_lstm <- function(split, epochs = 300, ...) {
    
    lstm_prediction <- function(split, epochs, ...) {
        
        # 5.1.2 Data Setup
        df_trn <- training(split)
        df_tst <- testing(split)
        
        df <- bind_rows(
            df_trn %>% add_column(key = "training"),
            df_tst %>% add_column(key = "testing")
        ) %>% 
            as_tbl_time(index = index)
        
        # 5.1.3 Preprocessing
        rec_obj <- recipe(value ~ ., df) %>%
            step_sqrt(value) %>%
            step_center(value) %>%
            step_scale(value) %>%
            prep()
        
        df_processed_tbl <- bake(rec_obj, df)
        
        center_history <- rec_obj$steps[[2]]$means["value"]
        scale_history  <- rec_obj$steps[[3]]$sds["value"]
        
        # 5.1.4 LSTM Plan
        lag_setting  <- 120 # = nrow(df_tst)
        batch_size   <- 40
        train_length <- 440
        tsteps       <- 1
        epochs       <- epochs
        
        # 5.1.5 Train/Test Setup
        lag_train_tbl <- df_processed_tbl %>%
            mutate(value_lag = lag(value, n = lag_setting)) %>%
            filter(!is.na(value_lag)) %>%
            filter(key == "training") %>%
            tail(train_length)
        
        x_train_vec <- lag_train_tbl$value_lag
        x_train_arr <- array(data = x_train_vec, dim = c(length(x_train_vec), 1, 1))
        
        y_train_vec <- lag_train_tbl$value
        y_train_arr <- array(data = y_train_vec, dim = c(length(y_train_vec), 1))
        
        lag_test_tbl <- df_processed_tbl %>%
            mutate(
                value_lag = lag(value, n = lag_setting)
            ) %>%
            filter(!is.na(value_lag)) %>%
            filter(key == "testing")
        
        x_test_vec <- lag_test_tbl$value_lag
        x_test_arr <- array(data = x_test_vec, dim = c(length(x_test_vec), 1, 1))
        
        y_test_vec <- lag_test_tbl$value
        y_test_arr <- array(data = y_test_vec, dim = c(length(y_test_vec), 1))
                
        # 5.1.6 LSTM Model
        model <- keras_model_sequential()

        model %>%
            layer_lstm(units            = 50, 
                       input_shape      = c(tsteps, 1), 
                       batch_size       = batch_size,
                       return_sequences = TRUE, 
                       stateful         = TRUE) %>% 
            layer_lstm(units            = 50, 
                       return_sequences = FALSE, 
                       stateful         = TRUE) %>% 
            layer_dense(units = 1)
        
        model %>% 
            compile(loss = 'mae', optimizer = 'adam')
        
        # 5.1.7 Fitting LSTM
        for (i in 1:epochs) {
            model %>% fit(x          = x_train_arr, 
                          y          = y_train_arr, 
                          batch_size = batch_size,
                          epochs     = 1, 
                          verbose    = 1, 
                          shuffle    = FALSE)
            
            model %>% reset_states()
            cat("Epoch: ", i)
            
        }
        
        # 5.1.8 Predict and Return Tidy Data
        # Make Predictions
        pred_out <- model %>% 
            predict(x_test_arr, batch_size = batch_size) %>%
            .[,1] 
        
        # Retransform values
        pred_tbl <- tibble(
            index   = lag_test_tbl$index,
            value   = (pred_out * scale_history + center_history)^2
        ) 
        
        # Combine actual data with predictions
        tbl_1 <- df_trn %>%
            add_column(key = "actual")
        
        tbl_2 <- df_tst %>%
            add_column(key = "actual")
        
        tbl_3 <- pred_tbl %>%
            add_column(key = "predict")
        
        # Create time_bind_rows() to solve dplyr issue
        time_bind_rows <- function(data_1, data_2, index) {
            index_expr <- enquo(index)
            bind_rows(data_1, data_2) %>%
                as_tbl_time(index = !! index_expr)
        }
        
        ret <- list(tbl_1, tbl_2, tbl_3) %>%
            reduce(time_bind_rows, index = index) %>%
            arrange(key, index) %>%
            mutate(key = as_factor(key))

        return(ret)
        
    }
    
    safe_lstm <- possibly(lstm_prediction, otherwise = NA)
    
    safe_lstm(split, epochs, ...)
    
}
```

We can test the custom `predict_keras_lstm()` function out with 10 epochs. It returns the data in long format with "actual" and "predict" values in the key column. 

```{r, eval=F}
predict_keras_lstm(split, epochs = 10)
```

```{r, echo=F}
readRDS("models/test_10.rds")
```

##### 5.2.2 Mapping The LSTM Prediction Function Over The 11 Samples

With the `predict_keras_lstm()` function in hand that works on one split, we can now map to all samples using a `mutate()` and `map()` combo. The predictions will be stored in a "list" column called "predict". __Note that this will take 5-10 minutes or so to complete.__

```{r, eval = F}
sample_predictions_lstm_tbl <- rolling_origin_resamples %>%
     mutate(predict = map(splits, predict_keras_lstm, epochs = 300))
```

```{r, echo=F}
sample_predictions_lstm_tbl <- readRDS("models/multiple_models.rds")
```

We now have the predictions in the column "predict" for all 11 splits!.  

```{r}
sample_predictions_lstm_tbl
```



##### 5.2.3 Assessing The Backtested Performance

We can assess the RMSE by mapping the `calc_rmse()` function to the "predict" column. 

```{r}
sample_rmse_tbl <- sample_predictions_lstm_tbl %>%
    mutate(rmse = map_dbl(predict, calc_rmse)) %>%
    select(id, rmse)

sample_rmse_tbl
```

```{r, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=4, out.width=400, fig.align="center"}
sample_rmse_tbl %>%
    ggplot(aes(rmse)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), fill = palette_light()[[1]], bins = 16) +
    geom_density(fill = palette_light()[[1]], alpha = 0.5) +
    theme_tq() +
    ggtitle("Histogram of RMSE")
```

And, we can summarize the RMSE for the 11 slices. __PRO TIP: Using the average and standard deviation of the RMSE (or other similar metric) is a good way to compare the performance of various models__.

```{r}
sample_rmse_tbl %>%
    summarize(
        mean_rmse = mean(rmse),
        sd_rmse   = sd(rmse)
    )
```

##### 5.2.4 Visualizing The Backtest Results

We can create a `plot_predictions()` function that returns one plot with the predictions for the entire set of 11 backtesting samples!!! 

```{r}
plot_predictions <- function(sampling_tbl, predictions_col, 
                             ncol = 3, alpha = 1, size = 2, base_size = 14,
                             title = "Backtested Predictions") {
    
    predictions_col_expr <- enquo(predictions_col)
    
    # Map plot_split() to sampling_tbl
    sampling_tbl_with_plots <- sampling_tbl %>%
        mutate(gg_plots = map2(!! predictions_col_expr, id, 
                               .f        = plot_prediction, 
                               alpha     = alpha, 
                               size      = size, 
                               base_size = base_size)) 
    
    # Make plots with cowplot
    plot_list <- sampling_tbl_with_plots$gg_plots 
    
    p_temp <- plot_list[[1]] + theme(legend.position = "bottom")
    legend <- get_legend(p_temp)
    
    p_body  <- plot_grid(plotlist = plot_list, ncol = ncol)
    
    
    
    p_title <- ggdraw() + 
        draw_label(title, size = 18, fontface = "bold", colour = palette_light()[[1]])
    
    g <- plot_grid(p_title, p_body, legend, ncol = 1, rel_heights = c(0.05, 1, 0.05))
    
    return(g)
    
}
```

Here's the result. On a data set that's not easy to predict, this is quite impressive!!

```{r, fig.height=8}
sample_predictions_lstm_tbl %>%
    plot_predictions(predictions_col = predict, alpha = 0.5, size = 1, base_size = 10,
                     title = "Keras Stateful LSTM: Backtested Predictions")
```

#### 5.3 Predicting The Next 10 Years

We can predict the next 10 years by adjusting the prediction function to work with the full data set. A new function, `predict_keras_lstm_future()`, is created that predicts the next 120 time steps (or ten years).

```{r}
predict_keras_lstm_future <- function(data, epochs = 300, ...) {
    
    lstm_prediction <- function(data, epochs, ...) {
        
        # 5.1.2 Data Setup (MODIFIED)
        df <- data
        
        # 5.1.3 Preprocessing
        rec_obj <- recipe(value ~ ., df) %>%
            step_sqrt(value) %>%
            step_center(value) %>%
            step_scale(value) %>%
            prep()
        
        df_processed_tbl <- bake(rec_obj, df)
        
        center_history <- rec_obj$steps[[2]]$means["value"]
        scale_history  <- rec_obj$steps[[3]]$sds["value"]
        
        # 5.1.4 LSTM Plan
        lag_setting  <- 120 # = nrow(df_tst)
        batch_size   <- 40
        train_length <- 440
        tsteps       <- 1
        epochs       <- epochs
        
        # 5.1.5 Train Setup (MODIFIED)
        lag_train_tbl <- df_processed_tbl %>%
            mutate(value_lag = lag(value, n = lag_setting)) %>%
            filter(!is.na(value_lag)) %>%
            tail(train_length)
        
        x_train_vec <- lag_train_tbl$value_lag
        x_train_arr <- array(data = x_train_vec, dim = c(length(x_train_vec), 1, 1))
        
        y_train_vec <- lag_train_tbl$value
        y_train_arr <- array(data = y_train_vec, dim = c(length(y_train_vec), 1))
        
        x_test_vec <- y_train_vec %>% tail(lag_setting)
        x_test_arr <- array(data = x_test_vec, dim = c(length(x_test_vec), 1, 1))
                
        # 5.1.6 LSTM Model
        model <- keras_model_sequential()

        model %>%
            layer_lstm(units            = 50, 
                       input_shape      = c(tsteps, 1), 
                       batch_size       = batch_size,
                       return_sequences = TRUE, 
                       stateful         = TRUE) %>%

        # 5.1.8 Predict and Return Tidy Data (MODIFIED)
        # Make Predictions
        pred_out <- model %>% 
            predict(x_test_arr, batch_size = batch_size) %>%
            .[,1] 
        
        # Make future index using tk_make_future_timeseries()
        idx <- data %>%
            tk_index() %>%
            tk_make_future_timeseries(n_future = lag_setting)
        
        # Retransform values
        pred_tbl <- tibble(
            index   = idx,
            value   = (pred_out * scale_history + center_history)^2
        )
        
        # Combine actual data with predictions
        tbl_1 <- df %>%
            add_column(key = "actual")

        tbl_3 <- pred_tbl %>%
            add_column(key = "predict")

        # Create time_bind_rows() to solve dplyr issue
        time_bind_rows <- function(data_1, data_2, index) {
            index_expr <- enquo(index)
            bind_rows(data_1, data_2) %>%
                as_tbl_time(index = !! index_expr)
        }

        ret <- list(tbl_1, tbl_3) %>%
            reduce(time_bind_rows, index = index) %>%
            arrange(key, index) %>%
            mutate(key = as_factor(key))

        return(ret)
        
    }
    
    safe_lstm <- possibly(lstm_prediction, otherwise = NA)
    
    safe_lstm(data, epochs, ...)
    
}
```

Next, run `predict_keras_lstm_future()` on the `sun_spots` data set. 

```{r, eval=F}
future_sun_spots_tbl <- predict_keras_lstm_future(sun_spots, epochs = 300)
```

```{r, echo=F}
future_sun_spots_tbl <- readRDS("models/future_model.rds")
```

Last, we can visualize the forecast with the `plot_prediction()` function, setting `id = NULL`. We can use `filter_time()` to zoom in on the dataset since 1900.  

```{r, fig.height=3.5}
future_sun_spots_tbl %>%
    filter_time("1900" ~ "end") %>%
    plot_prediction(id = NULL, alpha = 0.4, size = 1.5) +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
    ggtitle("Sunspots: Ten Year Forecast", subtitle = "Forecast Horizon: 2013 - 2023")
```


## Conclusions

This article demonstrates the power of a __Stateful LSTM__ built using the `keras` package. It's surprising how well the deep learning approach learned the trend given that the only feature provided was the lag at 120. The backtested model had an Average RMSE of 34 and a Standard Deviation RMSE of 13. While not shown in the article, we tested this against ARIMA and prophet, and the __LSTM outperformed__ both by a more than 30% reduction in average error and 40% reduction in standard deviation. __This shows the benefit of machine learning tool-application fit.__  

Beyond the deep learning approach used, the article also exposed methods to determine whether an LSTM is a good option for the given time series using __ACF plot__. We also exposed how the veracity of a time series model should be __benchmarked by backtesting__, a strategy that can be used for cross validation that preserves the sequential aspects of the time series.
